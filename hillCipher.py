    The intent of the filler is easily explained with an example:
    Take the message 'hello'. Because we have pre-established that the matrix will have 3 rows, without another character, the matrix multiplication and basically everything related to this program would cease to work.

    e o
    l _
    
    As depicted by the underscore, we have nothing there. This is problematic and thus, the 'filler' would fix this problem by appending the space which happens to be the index of 28 in the constant, ALPHABET
